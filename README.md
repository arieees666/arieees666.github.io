## About me
#### I'm just a student deeply interested in cybersec, especially on the fields of binary exploitation, exploit development, and anything malware related. Still getting started on the field tho, but will fearlessly continue to learn and grow. Aiming to be one of the top tier hackers within and representing the Philippines. *About will be updated sooner or later*
